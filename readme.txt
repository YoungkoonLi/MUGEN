# M.U.G.E.N Custom Build â€“ Character Tweaks & Fixes

This repository contains a customized M.U.G.E.N builds featuring a collection of characters, most of which were created by other talented authors. I DO NOT take credit for the development or original creation of the game or the majority of the characters included.

## What I Did

I made minor adjustments and fixes to a few characters within this build, including:

- Fixing sprite display/alignment issues
- Modifying state definitions to improve gameplay behavior
- Adjusting character mechanics for smoother play

These changes were made using Fighter Factory(https://fighterfactory.com/), and they are intended to improve compatibility, balance, or visual polish.
