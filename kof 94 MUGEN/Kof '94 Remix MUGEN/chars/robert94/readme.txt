Robert Version 0.66668

Heh, it seems that I've lost a bit of my interest in working with mugen during the last 2 months... But, I'm releasing another update for this char. This time Robert does have accurate KOF 98 damages for his Kof 94 style and accurate KI bar use for his attacks in the AOF style. I've fixed some bugs as well.
I don't know if I will update this char again. I'm trying to work with original stuff and I'll probably abandon all my non-original chars and projects in order to have enough free time.

I thank:

Sander: Those triggers you used for a better KOF hit style were really usefull.
LenaShock: For hours of enjoyable conversation and for accepting me at Mind Access. Thanks, my beloved friend. ^_^
NeoGouki: You're an awesome person. I wish we can meet one day.
All the M.A staff: You're great.
All my friends: You're too much to mention here. ;)
And you, for downloading this one.

Okay, another release. I fixed some bugs, corrected some velocities and sounds, and added a new fighting style, the Art Of Fighting one. You'll find more details on this in the commands.txt.

I wish to thank:

Kitsune Sniper: For the bug report.
True Bass: For being a good friend.
Ikari Loona: For helping me to beta test this version.
DeSouza: For suggestions on the throw and the sounds.

Thank you, guys. You're such a wonderfull beings.

Robert 94 Version 0.33334

This is the result of some days of boredom, depression and my last and failed try to have a girlfriend... now I'll try to find a boyfriend, maybe I can be more lucky...
Please, don't ask me why Robert 94? I don't have an answer for that question. All I know is that he is here now. 

Now, on the features of this version:
- Almost all moves with counted ticks (I haven't done that to the get hit anims yet).
- His velocities are almost identical of Kof ones
- His actual fighting style is Kof 94, with a bit of Kof 95 on it
- His DM works like the Kof 95 version, causing 1.5 times more damage when low on life and 
  with full bar

What is planned:
- Tweak his get hit animations
- Add a AOF fighting style and a Special Style
- Fix bugs I haven't found yet
- Add the Kof counter
- I wish I know...

My thanks goes to:
- Elecbyte: They know their stuff
- Sander7113: Thanks for the Kof hit velocities :)
- Kitsune: For being a nice friend :)
- KenMaster X: Another good friend :)
- SorrowEdge: Yet another good friend :)
- NeoGouki: You cute fellow, I love you :)
- DeSouza: For telling me about the channel 0 think for the playsnd :)
- SNK: AOF, AOF, AOF, AOF, AOF ;)
